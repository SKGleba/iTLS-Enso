# iTLS-Enso
Adds TLS v1.2 to devices with enso installed.

# How-To 
1) Install the provided VPK file.

2) Start the app, select "Install the full iTLS package" and wait til it finishes.
   - You may want to only install the new root certs, to do it select "Install the iTLS CA certs"

3) Reboot.

# FAQ
- Can I use it without enso?
  - Yes for the browser patch only.
- Where can I find the CA certs?
  - vs0:/data/external/cert/CA_LIST.cer

# Notes
- Since version 3.0 iTLS also patches app-side TLS stuff.
- Since version 3.2 iTLS also patches the NP server link on firmware 3.60.
- Updating CA certs may fix some problems with web sites, apps (like netflix), etc.
